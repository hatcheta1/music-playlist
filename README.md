# ruby-music-playlist

This is a command line interface app to create a playlist of songs.

You can add songs to the playlist, list all the songs of the playlist, list songs by genre, and shuffle the playlist.

To run the app from the command line, run the app.rb file (`ruby app.rb`). A list of options will come up and you will be prompted to choose an option. Enter the number of the option that you choose. For example, to quit the app you would simply enter "4".

If you choose option 1, you will then be prompted to enter the name, artist, and genre of a song. This song will be added to the playlist.

If you choose option 2, you will be asked if you want to see a list of all of the songs, or a list of the songs in a specific genre. If you choose the first option, a list of all the songs you have added will be displayed. If you choose the second option, you will be prompted to choose a genre. Then, a list of the songs of that genre that you have added to the playlist will be displayed.

If you choose option 3, your playlist will be shuffled and displayed in the shuffled order.

If you choose option 4, a goodbye message will be displayed and the app will end.
